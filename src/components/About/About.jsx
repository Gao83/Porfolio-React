          <p>I am a <strong>  Junior Full Stack Developer </strong>with Hotel Management and Sociology background and 15 years of experience in hospitality and food industry.</p>
          <p>The desire to <strong> reinvent myself </strong>along the motivation to learn and the curiosity that has accompanied me throughout my life, brought me to become a web developer.</p>
          <p>I intend to be considered, to be able to prove my worth as a frontend developer, continue to absorb knowledge and grow professionally as part of a team, and thus contribute my technical and personal skills. Also being able to give back to others that it is never too late and that with effort, perseverance, a certain adaptability and desire to learn something new, <strong> all change is possible. </strong></p>
